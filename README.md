# Kaggle_Disaster_tweets

This repository contains code used in the Kaggle competition: "Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets".
The code is provided as a Jupyter notebook and a standard python file.

For this competition, it had to be determined whether a tweet was about a natural disaster.
This involved implement natural language processing techniques, such as tidying the tweets to remove unwanted or unclear words that might confuse the model, tokenizing the different tweets on the 1000 most common words, and then using a neural network with an embedding layer.
